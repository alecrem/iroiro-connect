        Hi! I’m Ai Cremadeskaijo. I am currently living in Itoshima City,
        Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.

        I lived in the USA for 2 years when I was a junior high school student
        and I didn’t understand English at all when I first moved there. This
        experience taught me that what counts is your willingness to communicate
        and to understand even though you are not good at the language. After
        realizing that, I started to enjoy meeting new people, and getting to
        know different cultures and lifestyles. That’s why I also lived in Spain
        for one year also after some years working experience. I met my husband
        there!

        Until the end of 2018, I used to work at several offices related to
        foreign countries and enjoyed communicating with people from a diverse
        range of backgrounds and cultures. While meeting and talking to many
        people, there were so many surprises and so many situations which were
        difficult for me to understand. But every time I ended up understanding
        that each person is different, and that’s why I found it interesting to
        meet new people.

        Itoshima, where I live now, is a typical Japanese rural area surrounded
        by mountains and the ocean, but it’s also very close to Fukuoka, a
        larger city, and there are many interesting and attractive shops and
        restaurants, so it’s a convenient area too. Recently, many people moved
        here pursuing a better lifestyle, and I got to meet a number of
        international mixed families, as we too are an international couple with
        two kids. By talking to them, I realized that sometimes it’s hard to get
        the local information they need before coming to the place, even though
        that’s very important when making a big decision like relocating with a
        family.
      </StyledText>
      <StyledText mt="2em">
        There are all sorts of information on the internet, but sometimes you
        need some specific piece of information that is not on the internet.
        Also, any kind of issue could come up after relocating. So, I thought it
        would be fantastic if I could do something useful for someone by making
        use of my experience and circumstances.
      </StyledText>
      <StyledText mt="2em">
        That’s why I started “iroiro connect”. “Iroiro” is a Japanese word which
        means “a variety” or “many different kinds” of something, and I thought
        I can do “iroiro” things to make people happier or more comfortable, by
        corresponding to what they need. I think there are a decent number of
        small things I can do to help, as someone who moved to Itoshima with a
        family, as a member of international mixed family, as a mother, as
        someone who speaks Japanese, English, and Spanish.
      </StyledText>
      <StyledText mt="2em">
        I sincerely hope that more and more people with different cultures and
        occupations will move to Itoshima or Fukuoka from all over the world, so
        that children will be able to broaden their horizons naturally by
        meeting people from many countries.
